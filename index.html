        <h1>Neshel Willis</h1>

        <p>I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 2015. I majored in
          Leadership and Organizational Change (Management) with concentrations in Management
          and Supplychain and Service Management. During my time in school, I was interested in
          art, communications, and design so I made sure to take classes that gave me a
          well rounded education. Since I have a passion for many things, I try to find ways to
          combine all of my passions. I decided to take up web design since I remembered how
          much I enjoyed it back in high school and I've been looking for something fulfilling
          to fill my time.
